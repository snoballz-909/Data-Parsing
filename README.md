# Data-Parsing
A repository created with PowerShell and Python commands for basic data parsing.

The idea behind the creation of this repository stemmed from always finding myself needing to parse, reformat or convert data during my day to day. PowerShell and Python being readily available across Windows and Linux environemnts has proved most effective at working with data sets in a hurry.
